# PE_Binder

Thank you for your interest in my codes ....

These souce codes are wrote in C 

Functionality:

bind patch file with target file.

the target file will execute the patch file's code at first ,

and then execute its own code .

sometimes it's easier to inject a dll to a static PE file by this way .
